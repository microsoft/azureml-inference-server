# AzureML Inference Server

The HTTP server is the component that facilitates inferencing to deployed models. Requests made to the HTTP server run user-provided code that interfaces with the user models.
This server is used with most images in the Azure ML ecosystem, and is considered the primary component of the base image, as it contains the python assets required for inferencing.
This is the Flask server or the Sanic server code. The azureml-inference-server-http python package, wraps the server code and dependencies into a singular package.

## Quick Start

## <a name="virtualenv">Setting your environment</a>

- Clone the [azureml-inference-server](https://github.com/microsoft/azureml-inference-server) repository.
- Install [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install the virtualenv python package with `pip install virtualenv`.
- Create a new virtual environment with `virtualenv <env name>`, for example `virtualenv amlinf`.
- Activate the new environment.
  - In Windows, with `<env name>/scripts/activate`
  - In Linux, with `. <env name>/bin/activate`
