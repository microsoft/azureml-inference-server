"""
`print_log_hook.py` allows for interception of all calls to `print(...)` and
forwards the message according to a simple rule set:
1. If the message was intended to be printed to the stdout filestream, the
   message is instead logged to the `amlinfsrv.print` logger.
2. If the message was intended to be printed to any other file, the message
   is forwarded as provided to the builtin Python print function.
